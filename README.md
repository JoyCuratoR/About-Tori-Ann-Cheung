# üí´About Me :
Hello I'm Tori-Ann, nice to meet you! As a Passionate Data-Obsessed Analyst, who's curiosity ignited a learning journey that has no end, I synthesize complex data into insights and actionable recommendations in a way that professionals understand. 

## In Pursuit of Curiosity | Projects I've Done
1. Built a [Text Summarizer](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/PDF-Document-Summarizer) to outline the most important points of research papers in PDF format.
2. Using word & n-gram frequency analysis, I built a personalized list of words and phrases that optimizes what to learn first in a foreign language. 
3. Used SQL to find cities that are best for workations/digital nomads by measuring metrics based on highest amount of sunshine hours, fastest WIFI speed, and rent that is ‚â§ 1200 British pounds. 
4. Built an [automated Twitter bot](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/brainyquotebot) that scrapes 'quote of the day' from the website [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com)
5. Analyzed the [sentiment of Elden Ring's bosses](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/Elden-Ring-Sentiment-Analysis-Guide) using Reddit data and how much the bosses' sentiment ration contributed to the overall sentiment of the game.

## üöß Work-In-Progress Projects & Plans: 

1. Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

  ‚úÖ Course 1 - 7
  
  ‚è≥ Course 8: Capstone Project
  
For the capstone project, I'm analyzing data from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov) about Green House Gas Emissions. The story will be crafted for an imaginary renewable energy non-profit, called Radiant Renewable Energy. For this project, Radiant's goals are to increase donor/sponsor loyalty and incite more recurring donations from existing donors/sponsors. To achieve this, the data analytics team will work with the marketing team to create reports that demonstrate results of lowered emissions. These reports will be mailed to Radiant's donors/sponsors so they can be updated with evidence of their combined efforts. Additionally, these letters will have a call-to-action for continued support and donations to achieve greater heights and goals.

2. I'm planning on building a recommendation system to add as part of a project called Honeymoon. Honeymoon's purpose is to provide a detailed dashboard for a two-week trip to Europe. It'll contain travel routes of both inter-city transportation and city-to-city transportation such as trains & planes. Honeymoon will also track weather, ticket prices for air travel, and hotel/airbnb rental prices. Additionally, the project will hold information regarding the best attractions to go to and the best restaurants to eat at.

## üß≠ Side Quests: 

Right now, as part of a self-created challenge on Twitter (#3skills6weeks), I'm learning 3 skills (tidyverse, SQL, Tableau/ggplot2) in 6 weeks.

## üì¨ Conversation Starters: 

Ask me about how and why I got into data analytics/science & machine learning!

## üí¨ Fun Fact: 
Ever since I began bookbinding and making my own notebooks, I have more notebooks than I know what to do with.
