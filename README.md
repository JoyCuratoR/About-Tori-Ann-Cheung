2. I'm working on a recommendation system to add as part of a project called Honeymoon. Honeymoon's purpose is to provide a detailed dashboard for a two-week trip to Europe. It'll contain travel routes of both inter-city transportation and city-to-city transportation such as trains & planes. Honeymoon will also track weather, ticket prices for air travel, and hotel/airbnb rental prices. Additionally, the project will hold information regarding the best attractions to go to and the best restaurants to eat at.
