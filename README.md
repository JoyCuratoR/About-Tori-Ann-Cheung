# üí´About Me :
Hello I'm Tori-Ann, nice to meet you! 

## In Pursuit of Curiosity | Projects I've Done
1. Built a [Text Summarizer](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/PDF-Document-Summarizer) to outline the most important points of research papers in PDF format.
2. Using word & n-gram frequency analysis, I built a personalized list of words and phrases that optimizes what to learn first in a foreign language. 
3. Used SQL to find cities that are best for workations/digital nomads by measuring metrics based on highest amount of sunshine hours, fastest WIFI speed, and rent that is ‚â§ 1200 British pounds. 
4. Built an [automated Twitter bot](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/brainyquotebot) that scrapes 'quote of the day' from the website [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com)
5. Analyzed the [sentiment of Elden Ring's bosses](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/Elden-Ring-Sentiment-Analysis-Guide) using Reddit data and how much the bosses' sentiment ration contributed to the overall sentiment of the game.

  ‚úÖ Course 8: Capstone Project
  
For the capstone project, I'm analyzing data about Green House Gas Emissions gathered from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov). This project is designed with an imaginary non-profit called Radiant Renewable Energy, who's goal is to help businesses lower their emissions output. The premise is that Radiant Renewable Energy is partnered with several high emission-producing facilities and every month these partners send Radiant reports on the amount of emissions generated which Radiant compiles into yearly emission reports for each partnered facility. 

To keep the non-profit funding, Radiant relies on donations from their loyal pool of sponsors and donors. And in order to increase Radiant's existing donor loyalty, I will work with the marketing team to compile a dashboard made up of the partnered facilities' emission reports to supporters via Radiant's website.
