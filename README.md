# üí´About Me :
Hello I'm Tori-Ann, nice to meet you! 

## In Pursuit of Curiosity | Projects I've Done
1. As a way to volunteer my services to my local library, I gathered, organized, and analyzed Los Angeles County Library System to perform Resource Allocation Analysis. Check out the [project requirements](https://tori-ann.notion.site/Library-Resource-Allocation-Optimization-Work-In-Progress-a81ed799155c46fca469dac2d94a21fe).
2. I built a typewriter simulator which is a text editor where you can't use the backspace. Try it out here: [Typewriter app](https://joycurator.github.io/TypewriterSimulator/)
3. In part of completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate program, I created a capstone project to analyze Greenhouse Gas Emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Find the full report here: [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/joycuratoR/RadiantEnergy)
4. I analyzed AM Wedding Film Co. Facebook Ads data to identify and track Key Performance Identifiers and then based on the data insights, recommended actionable solutions that reduced marketing expenses by 5%.
5. The game Elden Ring exploded in popularity in 2022 and many Reddit users had negative and positive thoughts about its game mechanics. So using Reddit's API, I parsed and cleaned qualitative data to conduct sentiment analysis to discover the impact of Elden Ring's boss mechanics. Find the tutorial here: [Elden Ring Sentiment Analysis Tutorial](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/Elden-Ring-Sentiment-Analysis-Guide)
6. I created an automated Twitter account that requests Twitter's API to tweet daily inspirational quotes. Find the account here: [@SunshinecatLeo](https://twitter.com/SunshinecatLeo) and [build your own automated account with my tutorial](https://github.com/JoyCuratoR/brainyquotebot).

7. Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

   ‚úÖ Course 1 - 7
  
   ‚úÖ Course 8: Capstone Project
  
   For the capstone project, I'm analyzing data about Green House Gas Emissions gathered from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov). This project is designed  with an imaginary non-profit called Radiant Renewable Energy, who's goal is to help businesses lower their emissions output. The premise is that Radiant Renewable Energy is partnered with several high emission-producing facilities and every month these partners send Radiant reports on the amount of emissions generated which Radiant compiles into yearly emission reports for each partnered facility. 

   To keep the non-profit funding, Radiant relies on donations from their loyal pool of sponsors and donors. And in order to increase Radiant's existing donor loyalty, I will work with the marketing team to compile a dashboard made up of the partnered facilities' emission reports to supporters via Radiant's website.
