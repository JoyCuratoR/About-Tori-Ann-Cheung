# üí´About Me :
I'm currently working on a recommendation system to add as part of a project called Honeymoon. Honeymoon's purpose is to provide a detailed dashboard for a two-week trip to Europe. It'll contain travel routes of both inter-city transportation and city-to-city transportation such as trains & planes. Honeymoon will also track weather, ticket prices for air travel, and hotel/airbnb rental prices. Additionally, the project will hold information regarding the best attractions to go to and the best restaurants to eat at.

I'm currently learning about sentiment analysis and learning from BCG's (Boston Consulting Group) Climate & Sustainability virtual experience program.

Ask me about how and why I got into data analytics/science & machine learning!

Ever since I began bookbinding and making my own notebooks, I have more notebooks than I know what to do with.
